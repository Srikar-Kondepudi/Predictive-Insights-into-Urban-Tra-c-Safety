# Predictive-Insights-into-Urban-Trafic-Safety
This project applies data science and machine learning techniques to over 500,000 vehicular collision records to identify patterns and develop predictive models for accident hotspots. By using XGBoost and Random Forest models, our team achieved a 70.59% accuracy in pinpointing accident-prone areas. Further application of regression analysis and statistical methods refined these predictions, offering data-driven insights that could potentially reduce accidents by an estimated 10%.

Project Overview

Context
In todayâ€™s urbanized environments, the surge in vehicular traffic has escalated the frequency of traffic collisions, which pose significant economic and human safety risks. Our project addresses this issue by utilizing comprehensive collision data to enhance urban road safety.

Objectives
Descriptive Analysis: Investigate accident distributions by time, location, and vehicle types to identify high-risk scenarios.
Factor Analysis: Analyze primary factors contributing to collisions, focusing on environmental, vehicular, and human elements.
Predictive Modeling: Develop models to forecast future accident hotspots to proactively prevent collisions.
Data

The project leverages a robust dataset from data.gov featuring over 2 million incidents with 29 different attributes such as crash date, time, location, and involved vehicle types.

Data Cleaning and Preparation
Key steps included:

Handling missing values
Data type conversions
Outlier detection and removal
Redundant column elimination
Text data standardization
Techniques and Tools Used
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy
Methods: Geospatial analysis, time series analysis, machine learning (XGBoost, Random Forest)
Results and Impact

Our predictive models and analyses allow city planners and traffic management authorities to implement focused interventions, potentially reducing the frequency and severity of traffic collisions significantly.
